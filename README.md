In Milestone 2, I implemented a chat completions endpoint for my application. This involved defining database models for providers and responses, creating a view function to handle POST requests and validate inputs, configuring URL patterns, and populating the database with predefined static responses. I also integrated this functionality with a frontend interface, allowing users to select a provider and model, enter a prompt, and receive responses. This setup ensured that requests are routed correctly, validated, and responded to with predefined data, laying a solid foundation for a scalable and modular chat application.
